# GWAlpha
Genome-wide estimate of genetic effects from pool sequencing data

GWAlpha is a suite of scripts implementing a parametric method for estimating the additive effect of SNPs and small Indels on quantitative traits from pool-sequencing experiments.

For details about the method, installation and implementation please read the GWAlpha_manual.pdf file
